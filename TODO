  custom linux-pam configuration to run tests against?.
* add 'check' target to makefile: run spellcheck, linter (clang?) and unit tests.
* add readme
* add versioning
* add 'install' target to makefile
* document build dependencies - libsodium-devel, pam-devel, make, gcc (fedora)
* builddeps ubuntu - libsodium-dev, libpam0g-dev, libc-bin(?), make, gcc

* write a README
* generate gh-pages website
* use travis or another online ci
