* a binary that generates a one time password: either time based (180 seconds) or while the binary is running.
* a pam module that can authenticate the same user with the one time password.

* the binary 'otl' will output the password to stdout
* use a strong password generation library
* the password won't be stored in memory, a hash(?) will be stored with a timestamp for timeout.
* allow the user to input the one time password

* use otpw and pam_systemd as code samples for pam modules.
